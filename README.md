- **Design and create a data warehouse for the Expense database**
```
USE expense;

-- DW Creation

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW dw AS

       total_trip_days, ROUND(total_reimbursement,2) AS total_reimbursement,

-- Display first 25 rows

SELECT * FROM expense.dw LIMIT 25;

- **Create four SQL queries on your data warehouse that answer interesting questions**
1. Q1: How many employees in each department?[^1]
[^1]:My 1st question is about to see whatâ€™s the headcount for each department and the firm.
<br />I found that the firm has 99 employees and sales department has the most employees.

```
-- Q1: How many employees in each department?
SELECT dept_name, COUNT(ssn) AS headcount
FROM dw
GROUP BY dept_name
WITH ROLLUP
ORDER BY headcount; 
```
*Query 1 screenshot:*
<br />![Q1](q1.png)

2. Q2: Who traveled the most and how many times?[^2]
[^2]: My 2nd question is to show me who traveled the most in the firm.
<br />I found that Precious Robin Traveled the most, which is 24 times in total.

```
-- Q2: Who traveled the most and how many times?
SELECT first_name, last_name, total_trip_times
FROM dw
ORDER BY total_trip_times DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
*Query 2 screenshot:*
<br />![Q2](q2.png)

3. Q3: What's the average reimbursement for each department?[^3]
[^3]:My 3rd question tells me average reimbursement of every department
<br />It shows that executive have highest average reimbursement, almost double the sales department, which is the second place.

```
-- Q3: What's the average reimbursement for each department?
SELECT dw.dept_name, headcount, ROUND(SUM(total_reimbursement),2) AS total_reimbursement,
       ROUND(SUM(total_reimbursement)/headcount,2) AS average_reimbursement
FROM dw
    JOIN ( SELECT dept_name, COUNT(ssn) AS headcount
           FROM dw
           GROUP BY dept_name
           ORDER BY headcount DESC
		 ) Q1
	  ON dw.dept_name = Q1.dept_name
GROUP BY dept_name
ORDER BY average_reimbursement DESC;
```
*Query 3 screenshot:*
<br />![Q3](q3.png)

4. Q4: Who's expense is higher than average expense per day?[^4]
[^4]:My last question aims to show employees who have expenses higher than average
<br />From the result I found that 38 out of 99 employees have higher expense, Macaulay Delaney is the highest.

```
SELECT first_name, last_name, ROUND(expense_per_day,2) AS expense_per_day
FROM  ( SELECT first_name, last_name, total_expense/total_trip_days AS expense_per_day, average_expense_per_day
        FROM dw 
		JOIN ( SELECT SUM(total_expense)/SUM(total_trip_days) AS average_expense_per_day FROM dw 
			 ) AS avgExpense ) AS dailyExpense
WHERE expense_per_day > average_expense_per_day
ORDER BY expense_per_day DESC;
```
